            <h2 style="color:blue; font-family:cursive; ">Weather</h2>
<p style="color:red">Rain and dull clouds, windy blue skies, cold snow, and sticky heat are very different conditions, yet they are all weather. Weather is the mix of events
    that happen each day in our atmosphere. Weather is different in different parts of the world and changes over minutes, hours, days and weeks.</p>
    <h2 style="color:orange; font-family:cursive;">Climate</h2>
    <p style="color:green">Climate is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area. Weather can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day, month-to-month
         or even year-to-year. A region's weather patterns, usually tracked for at least 30 years, are considered its climate. Different parts of the world have different climates.</p>
